## 🚩 Challenge 3: 📡 Transaction Parser 🔎

this is an exploration to see if we could make a challenge about this

it is really hard to get all the transactions for a given account!!!

you need to look through every transaction from every block



the test scripts are mostly located at `packages/indexer`

run `node downloader.js` to start a process to download all the blocks as json files

run `node index.js` to look through transactions for specific addresses


This branch has a geth node that will run at:

```bash
yarn geth
```



🏗 scaffold-eth is just a simple frontend here
