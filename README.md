## 🚩 Challenge 8: 📡 Indexer & Node 🛰

> 👩‍💻 Running your own Ethereum node at home helps the whole network, but it also can be useful for you. In this challenge you'll use an indexer script to list for specific transactions on-chain. This will overload Infura so you'll need to query your own local node to keep up.
